## Topic

My topic for my instructional technical writing paper is "How to properly train your bird dog using homing pigeons". I have immense experience in training my families bird dogs, using our own homing pigeons. It is a complex process, but can be mastered with proper technique, equipment, and instructions. I spend my summer's back home training our dogs using our homing pigeons and it is a great way to be active and make sure our dogs are prepared for the season. I think instructions would work for this topic because it includes an in depth process and following certain steps are required for success.  


## Rough Draft for Training Bird Dogs Instructions

## Introduction: Background

Training bird dogs is essential for any hunter that wishes to have success on an actual bird hunt. Whether it be quail, pheasant, or any other upland game bird, having a well trained dog will increase birds found and birds shot. The method of training which will specifically drawn out will be one that utilizes homing pigeons. This method is unique because most training methods use bird dummies or dead birds, while this method uses live birds that truly give a simulation of hunting for the dogs being trained. These instructions are driven towards novice upland bird hunters, or hunters with newly aquired bird dogs. 

## Introduction: Supplies and Method of Instructions

Training your bird dog may sound simple, one may think you only require a dog and a bird to train. However there are a minimum of item and land required to successfully have a training session using homing pigeons. Minimum requires items include:
