## Topic

My topic for my instructional technical writing paper is "How to properly train your bird dog using homing pigeons". I have immense experience in training my families bird dogs, using our own homing pigeons. It is a complex process, but can be mastered with proper technique, equipment, and instructions. I spend my summer's back home training our dogs using our homing pigeons and it is a great way to be active and make sure our dogs are prepared for the season. I think instructions would work for this topic because it includes an in depth process and following certain steps are required for success.

## Rough Draft for Training Bird Dogs Instructions



## Introduction: Background

Training bird dogs is essential for any hunter that wishes to have success on an actual bird hunt. Whether it be quail, pheasant, or any other upland game bird, having a well trained dog will increase birds found and birds shot. The method of training which will specifically drawn out will be one that utilizes homing pigeons. This method is unique because most training methods use bird dummies or dead birds, while this method uses live birds that truly give a simulation of hunting for the dogs being trained. Upland bird hunting consists of hunting quail and pheasant in most places. My place of origin (Central and Western Oklahoma) is one of the best places to hunt either one.  

Over the last five years I have trained our three Epagnuel Bretons with my father, and we have become experts at training our dogs using our 30+ homing pigeons. Homing pigeons are an amazing animal to have, because no matter what they will always return to roost everyday. Our loft is situated in our backyard, about 10 miles from where we train.

## Introduction: Supplies and Method of Instructions

Training your bird dog may sound simple, one may think you only require a dog and a bird to train. However there are a minimum of item and land required to successfully have a training session using homing pigeons. **Minimum required** items include: 

- atleast 10 acres of land
- atleast 1 homing pigeon
- a shotgun that can either shoot blanks or live ammunition
- a cage that is capable of holding the pigeon until release is necessary
- a long rope capable of attaching to your dog's collar
- a dummy quail
- 1 bird dog

For when you become an expert with the basic tools, you may need to upgrade your items for training. **Upgraded items** include:

- 25+ acres of land
- 10+ homing pigeons
- remote controled bird launch
- remote controlled ecollar to control your dog
- quail or pheasant scent extract
- multiple bird dogs

*These instructions are meant for the novice upland bird hunters ready to simulate an actual hunt with their bird dogs*, so these instructions will include the minimum requirements for training your dog. The process of training with homing pigeons depends on following a set of specific instructions in a step by step manor. That is how the instructions will be presented, in a step by step procedure. 

## Step 1: Set up the Field

Once on the land you plan to train on, you will need to pick a place to put your pigeon. It is highly recommended you use an open field, with plenty of flight room for the bird to take off and for your dog to work. Place the caged pigeon about 150 yards from where you will releasing your bird dog. You want to give your dog plenty of oppurtunity to run the field, and give it an oppurtunity to catch scent of the bird before he runs up on it. Also place the bird in a spot that will be up wind of where your dog will be coming from. Having the bird's scent blowing towards the dog will make it much easier for the scent of the bird to be smelled by the dog and for a point to occur. 

With the pigeon in it's cage and placed in the field where it is up wind of where you will be releasing your dog, it is time to ensure the bird is covered up in grass. This will make sure it will not be seen by the dog, instead it will have to rely on it's nose to find the mystery bird. 

## Step 2: Ready and Release your Dog

With your homing pigeon ready in the field, now it is time to ready your dog. Attach the rope to your dog's collar and load your shotgun with either blanks or live shells. Hold your dog steady, facing it in the direction of the field. Calm your dog, focusing it on the situation at hand. Then release your dog saying "Find a bird". This phrase is one that will be used in an actual hunting situation, so use it here as well. As your dog runs the field, follow it closely behind because when it gains scent of the bird you will need to grab the rope to hold your dog steady. 

## Step 3: Finding the Homing Pigeon

Your dog will eventually catch scent of the bird and will halt. It will "point" towards the bird's location. At this point grab the rope attached to your dog's collar and hold it in case your dog tries to move forward. It is very important to keep your dog steady and not have it run towards the bird. In an actaul hunting situation your dog must be still and hold it's point, in order for you to move in and flush the bird to shoot it. 

## Step 4: Releasing the Homing Pigeon and Simulating the Hunt

Continue to hold your dog steady and repeat the phrase "woah". Keep "woahing" your dog to ensure it understands to stay still. Now move in and flip the cage in which the pigeon is staying. The pigeon will take off and begin flying back towards it's homing loft. As soon as the bird takes off from the cage, you need to throw the quail dummy in the air and fire the shotgun in the direction you threw it. **This action is the most important part of this exercise**. The throwing of the dummy and the shooting of the shotgun simulate what should happen during an actual live hunt. Continue to hold the rope to keep your dog steady after you shoot the shotgun. *Training your dog to retrieve is another set of instructions*. After a few seconds you can release your dog. Now your dog should undertsand to stay steady from the point it smells the bird to the point that you have fired your shotgun and the bird is ready to be fetched. 

## Step 5: Praise your Dog

If your dog did a good job of staying steady (which it should have if you held onto the rope) make sure to praise it. Praising your dog is important, because it will understand that what it just did was good. It will understand that finding a bird and holding steady is what it needs to do. Bird dogs love to find birds and once they have successfully done a training exercise such as the one you have just completed, they will want to do it all again. 

## Step 6: Clean Up

Pick up the cage the pigeon was in and pick up the dummy you threw. Walk your dog back out of the field and load it up to leave. Once you have acquired more of the advanced tools for training with homing pigeons, as mentioned above in the introduction, you will be able to train for multiple hours. For now though you have completed your first training for your bird dog using your own homing pigeon. Congratulations!


## FAQ

How many dogs could I train on a single planted bird? 
*It is recommended that you only use one, as it is better to train one on one*

How long does a single training session take?
*For only a single planted bird, it will take about 15 minutes for everything*

After how many trainings can I begin to actually hunt? 
*Hunt as soon as you want to. Training is important, but so is exposure to the real thing. It will be rough at first, but over time your dog will be a champ!*

What time of day do you recommend to train?
*Since the majority of training season is during the summer, get your training done early in the morning to keep you and your dog cool*

What age can I start training my dog?
*At about 9-12 months of age*

## Pitfalls

- Avoid training in rocky terrain where a spranged ankle could occure or rattle snakes are present
- Always bring water to keep you and your dog hydrated, and avoid feeding your dog until after training has ended
- Do not give up if you or your dog messes up, this is a training for novice dogs and mistakes will be made
- Avoid fields with too short of grass that cannot sufficiently cover the pigeon, the grass should be waste high
