## Topic

My topic for my instructional technical writing paper is "How to properly train your bird dog using homing pigeons". I have immense experience in training my families bird dogs, using our own homing pigeons. It is a complex process, but can be mastered with proper technique, equipment, and instructions. I spend my summer's back home training our dogs using our homing pigeons and it is a great way to be active and make sure our dogs are prepared for the season. I think instructions would work for this topic because it includes an in depth process and following certain steps are required for success.
